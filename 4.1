>> %4.1 Create the following matrices, and use them in the exercises that follow:
>> a=[15 3 22;3 8 5;14 3 82]

a =

    15     3    22
     3     8     5
    14     3    82

>> b=[1;5;6]

b =

     1
     5
     6

>> c=[12 18 5 2]

c =

    12    18     5     2

>> %(a) Create a matrix called d from the third column of matrix a.
%(b) Combine matrix b and matrix d to create matrix e, a two-dimensional matrix with three rows and two columns.
%(c) Combine matrix b and matrix d to create matrix f, a one-dimensional matrix with six rows and one column.
%(d) Create a matrix g from matrix a and the f rst three elements of matrix c,with four rows and three columns.
%(e) Create a matrix h with the f rst element equal to a1,3, the second element equal to c1,2, and the third element equal to b2,1.
